# Speed Dating Analysis Project

This project is based on a real world speed dating experiment held at Columbia University. Using Python and data visualization tools, we explore how people choose a potential partner and what influences their decisions
The goal? To understand what people say they want in a partner, what actually drives a match, and how perceptions (both self and social) align with outcomes.


Project Objectives
•	Analyze what individuals think they want in a potential partner versus what leads to an actual match
•	Investigate whether traits like attractiveness, sincerity, or shared interests truly matter
•	Examine the role of race, field of study, and career path in match outcomes
•	Study if people can accurately understand how others see them
•	Explore whether meeting someone early or late in the evening impacts success
•	Assess how social behaviors and hobbies relate to dating preferences

Methods and Techniques
•	Data cleaning (handling NaN, merging partner traits, mapping labels)
•	Grouped statistics and segmentation by gender
•	Visualizations: bar plots, heatmaps, spider charts
•	Exploratory analysis across preferences, ratings, and actual match outcomes

Key Insights
•	Participants consistently overestimate their attractiveness relative to how others rated them
•	Fun personalities and shared interests predicted better match outcomes than physical traits or racial similarity
•	Meeting someone early in the evening provided a slight advantage, but personality mattered more than timing
•	Preferences often varied by gender, but shared experiences were universally valued

Notebook Structure
•	Part 1: Participant expectations vs. actual outcomes
•	Part 2: Match drivers race, religion, career, field of study, interests
•	Part 3: Social activity, hobbies, and dating dynamics


Tech Stack
•	Python (Jupyter Notebook)
•	Pandas, NumPy
•	Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
