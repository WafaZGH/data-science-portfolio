# Speed Dating Analysis Project

#  Speed Dating Analysis

This project is based on a real-world speed dating experiment held at Columbia University.  
Using Python and data visualization tools, we explore how people choose a potential partner and what influences their decisions.

#The goal?

To understand what people say they want in a partner, what actually drives a match, and how perceptions (both self and social) align with outcomes.



##  Project Objectives

- Analyze what individuals *say* they want in a partner vs. what actually leads to a match  
- Investigate whether traits like attractiveness, sincerity, or shared interests truly matter  
- Examine the role of race, field of study, and career path in match outcomes  
- Study if people can accurately understand how others perceive them  
- Explore whether meeting someone earlier in the evening impacts match success  
- Assess how social behaviors and hobbies relate to dating preferences  



##  Methods & Techniques

- Data cleaning (handling NaNs, merging partner traits, mapping categorical labels)
- Grouped statistics and gender-based segmentation
- Visualizations: bar plots, heatmaps, radar/spider charts
- Exploratory analysis on preferences, ratings, and actual outcomes



## Key Insights

- Participants consistently overestimated their own attractiveness compared to how others rated them  
- Fun personalities and shared interests were better predictors of a match than physical traits or racial similarity  
- Meeting someone earlier in the evening gave a slight advantage, but personality had a stronger impact  
- Preferences varied by gender, but shared experiences were valued across the board  



## Notebook Structure

1. **Participant expectations vs. actual outcomes**
2. **Match drivers:** race, religion, career, field of study, interests
3. **Social activity, hobbies, and dating dynamics**



##  Tech Stack

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`
